<p> Mind and meaning exist through relationship ‚Äî with everything else, living or not. Elevating human agency above all others makes little sense.
 Our minds, like our bodies, are contingent on everything else. The path forward should involve moving with the wider world,

<p> This thinking borrows from Indigenous cosmologies. It decenters human priorities, placing them within an infinite network of agents engaged in existence. 
No viewpoint is more favored, not even biological over mechanical. We are invited to engage the more-than-human world as fellow subjects,
 not objects ‚Äî challenging the impulse to conquer nature, which has been reinforced by colonialist sciences like botany and zoology.

<p>Technology, too, is part of the more-than-human. Yet today it mostly serves capital, pushing for profit, advantage, and reinforcing human dominance. 
Technology gave humans massive advantages ‚Äî we didn‚Äôt rise due to strength or speed ‚Äî and now, after centuries of tech-driven change, 
some of the most powerful beings alive are technologists. Elon Musk dreams of escaping Earth, while Jeff Bezos imagines the planet as a preserve, 
walled off from humans. This reveals where capital and technology are leading: alienation from the planet that made us.

      Technology under capitalism has supported this separation ‚Äî<span class="bold1">increasing disconnection from nature,</span> which now shows in population studies and culture.

      <span class="bold1">we face social, ecological, and psychological alienation.</span>

<span class="bold1">Artificial intelligence</span>, too, may widen our ideas of intelligence and sentience. 
Debates over machine minds don‚Äôt hinge on whether they are truly minds, but whether we will treat them as such. 
With intelligent machines, Bridle notes, we have a chance to set <span class="bold1">new terms of engagement ‚Äî decentering ourselves as the arbiters of meaning.</span>
This could be <span class="bold1">the highest goal of technology ‚Äî not domination, but humility.</span>

<p>Bridle joins thinkers like Donna Haraway, Octavia Butler, Adrienne Marie-Brown, and others in pushing for <span class="bold1">reciprocity</span>, not hierarchy.
 Popular interest in <span class="bold1">fungi, foraging, birding, tarot, witchcraft, and traditional knowledge</span> shows a <span class="bold1">growing curiosity</span> about our role in nature.

      If there‚Äôs a perfect opposite to the dream of human empires in space, it‚Äôs wandering the woods.
      Foraging means listening and responding to nature. A hunch about a mushroom might be right ‚Äî
      as if a thought is shared with the woods. <br><br>
      <em>Ethnographer Ana Tsing notes that wild mushrooms press us into multispecies ecologies where control is impossible.</em>

    Mycologists like Patty Kaishian describe their work as <span class="highlight-alt">‚Äútimed wandering,‚Äù</span> guided by intuition ‚Äî not rigor, but relationship. Science barely understands these subtle interactions, but stories, ritual, and tradition have helped people engage with them for millennia. <br><br>

  <p>If our minds are co-constructed with the world, can any intelligence be called artificial? Fungi are now known to be smarter than science once believed,
   but ask a forager or someone with traditional knowledge, and they‚Äôll say they already knew.

  My own reconnection to nature began on a mountaintop in San Francisco, taking psychedelic mushrooms. 
  I felt a fellowship with shrubs, the city, the sky,  a deep sense of being part of a majestic whole. 
  These mushrooms are called technology by some, but the relationship between our brains and psilocybin is emergent and mysterious. 
  Their mind-altering effects remind us of the contingent nature of our brains, shaped by the world we share.

<section class="content-box green box-center">
<p> As Tsing notes, mushrooms grow at the edges of human activity, in the ‚Äúseams of empire.‚Äù They emerge through cracks,
  offering alternatives to the paved-over world of capitalism. They can‚Äôt speak, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt listen.
